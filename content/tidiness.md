There is no point in talking about hygiene and cleanliness if your spaces are untidy. In principle, it's possible to clean an untidy room, but not only it's _exponentially_ harder to clean, it doesn't _feel_ clean. Think of tidiness as the foundation in which to build cleanliness.

## The KonMari Method

By far, the best book on tidiness is [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing by Marie Kondo](https://amzn.to/2CvMLof). While this book teaches you how to declutter your home physically, it focuses on something deeper: the required mindset to _become_ tidy. While _doing_ the things in this book, you will learn how to _become_ tidy in your physical spaces, your virtual spaces, and - most importantly - your mind.

To me, the results of executing this process, and applying these principles and philosophy were impressive. I now own exactly what I need, no more, no less, every single item sparks joy, and I can account for everything I own and know every single place where it should be placed, by heart. I applied these principles to my virtual spaces as well: my laptop's files and folders and my social networks and I deleted most of them. I also applied these principles to my relationships and decided to stop investing in 38 relationships that did not spark joy. This created the space necessary for me to realize I should invest in some other friendships and that was an incredibly good decision.

By the end of this process I feel I've achieved the following:
 - A permanent state of tidiness
 - My physical spaces have become much simpler and beautiful.
 - I discarded many of my laptop's files and folders that I didn't actually need and it's much easier to navigate around my files and folders and to work.
 - My phone has a lot less apps and is much more simple and organized.
 - I deleted a bunch of social network accounts I wasn't actually using and that I realized really had no purpose for me.
 - I discarded a lot of relationships that weren't making me happy and focused my attention in those that do.
 - When it comes to my possessions, I'm no longer attached to the past or fearful about the future, and I therefore no longer keep items because "I don't want to let go of this photo" or "I may need this item some day". I realized both these types of items have already fulfilled their purpose and I can now let them go. I learned the importance of discarding and I now discard with a passion, keeping only items that are necessary and/or spark joy. I've also learned to make really smart purchases through the same lenses: I only buy things that are useful _and_ spark joy.
 - Most importantly, I now am the proud owner of a set of principles that help me make hard decisions fast and with absolute confidence.

I am purposefully talking about the results that I had by reading this book, without talking about the _why_, i.e. the principles or the philosophy as a whole, because I want to motivate you to read the book and it would be redundant.

There is no progress without action. So, now that I've given you a taste for the kinds of results that you can achieve by reading, planning and executing on this book, here's the mission:
1. Read [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing by Marie Kondo](https://amzn.to/2CvMLof)
2. As you read, construct a plan of action
3. When you're done reading the book, add the following to your plan:
3.1. Tidy your computer
3.2. Tidy your phone
3.3. Tidy your social networks.
3.4. Tidy your relationships.
4. Execute on that plan
