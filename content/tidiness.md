There is no point in talking about hygiene and cleanliness if your spaces are untidy. In principle, it's possible to clean an untidy room, but not only it's _exponentially_ harder to clean, it doesn't _feel_ clean. Think of tidiness as the foundation in which to build cleanliness.

## The KonMari Method

By far, the best book on tidiness is [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing by Marie Kondo](https://amzn.to/2CvMLof). While this book teaches you how to declutter your home physically, it focuses on something deeper: the required mindset to _become_ tidy. While _doing_ the things in this book, you will learn how to _become_ tidy in your physical spaces, your virtual spaces, and - most importantly - your mind.

To me, the results of executing this process, and applying these principles and philosophy were impressive. I now own exactly what I need, no more, no less, every single item sparks joy, and I can account for everything I own and know every single place where it should be placed, by heart. I applied these principles to my virtual spaces as well: my laptop's files and folders and my social networks and I deleted most of them. I also applied these principles to my relationships and decided to stop investing in 38 relationships that did not spark joy. This created the space necessary for me to realize I should invest in some other friendships and that was an incredibly good decision.

By the end of this process I feel I've achieved the following:
 - A permanent state of tidiness
 - When it comes to my possessions, I'm no longer attached to the past or fearful about the future, and I therefore no longer keep items because "I don't want to let go of this photo" or "I may need this item some day". I realized both these types of items have already fulfilled their purpose and I can now let them go. I learned the importance of discarding and I now discard with a passion, keeping only items that are necessary and/or spark joy. I've also learned to make really smart purchases through the same lense: I only buy things that are useful _and_ spark joy.
 - My physical and virtual spaces have become much better to live in and much easier to clean.
 - My relationships have greatly improved through this process.
