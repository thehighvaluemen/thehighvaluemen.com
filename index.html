<h2 id="your-space">Your space</h2>
<p>Before you can start working on having a clean body, you need to clean your spaces. There is no point in being clean if you live in a pigsty. If you want to learn how to keep your home clean, you need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Understand the problem</li>
<li>Plan a solution</li>
<li>Execute on that solution</li>
</ol>
<p>If this doesn&#39;t work, you didn&#39;t understand the problem, your plan is bad or, obviously, you didn&#39;t execute correctly. Go back and fix whatever failed.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-problem-why-do-spaces-get-dirty-">Understanding the problem: why do spaces get dirty?</h3>
<p>Assuming you live in a developed country (if you don&#39;t live in a developed country you have bigger problems to solve), your biggest source of dirt is dust in various forms. Let&#39;s understand dust and where dust comes from.</p>
<p>Dust has two sources: 60% of dust comes from the exterior as airborne particles blown from outdoors and tracked-in soil and 40% of dust comes from dead skin shed by people, fibers from carpets, upholstered furniture, pet dander, dust mites (the more dust you have, the more dust mites and vice-versa), food debris and insects and their droppings.</p>
<p>To make this easy to understand, let&#39;s look at the following table:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Source</th>
<th>Breakdown</th>
<th>Absolute Weight</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Exterior</td>

<td>60%</td>

<p>Obviously, this can only be a rough approximation because every home is different. If you leave your shoes in your entrance hall and you have no carpets, you&#39;ll have no tracked-in soil and no carpet fibers flying around, for example. Nevertheless, having this rough sketch of where dust comes from is an excelent starting point to keep our home clean.</p>
<p>Now that we understand what dust is and where it comes from, let&#39;s attack each source one by one.</p>
<p>Note: I&#39;m a passionate perfectionist, so everything I will say on this and the following topics will be optimized for their most important criteria. In the topic of higiene, the criteria is health and cleanliness. Not style, not decoration. Cleanliness. Health and cleanliness trump style and decoration.</p>
<h3 id="plan-to-solve-the-problem">Plan to solve the problem</h3>
<p>We have several sources of dust. Let&#39;s divide and conquer each.</p>
<h4 id="airborne-particles-blown-from-the-outdoors">Airborne particles blown from the outdoors</h4>
<p>You NEED to air your rooms, ideally every day. Not airing your rooms is not an option because otherwise you will have mold accumulate and rapidly decrease your air quality. Ideally we&#39;d be able to air the rooms in our home while filtering the air coming in from the windows, but since we don&#39;t have that technology yet, with current technology our best option is to let all that fresh air in and purify it post factum.</p>
<p>You have two main ways to keep your air clean and pure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Having a <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/whole-house-air-purifiers/perfect16">whole-house air purifier system with HEPA filters</a> that pulls air from the outside, filters it and delivers clean, pure air to all rooms in your home. Also using <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/putting-tesla-hepa-filter-and-bioweapon-defense-mode-to-the-test">Tesla&#39;s model S and model X bioweapon defence mode</a> keeps you breathing pure air while in your car. Both keep dust, pollen, mold spores, bacteria, viruses and pollution particles outside your spaces.</li>
<li>Having a</li>

Portable air purifier vs whole-house air purifier - which is better?
By the way, you should keep your air purifier turned on 24/7?

<p>The problem with airborne particles blown from the outdoors is that you NEED your home to be aired very often. Idealy, every single day. Otherwise mold will start to rapidly accumulate and the air quality in your rooms will deteriorate very fast leading to breathing disorders and deseases. So NOT airing your rooms is not an option. Unless, you&#39;re building a home from the ground up and want to specifically address this issue by installing a whole-house air purifier system that uses HEPA filters, this means that you WILL have to deal with airborne particles blown from the outdoors.</p>
