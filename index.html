								<h2>Introduction</h2>
							</header><p>Do you want to become a high-value man? Read on.</p>
<p>At a fundamental level, all you have is your brain. There is a strong correlation between the quality of your thinking and the quality of your life. This is why we start with tidiness and cleanliness. You won&#39;t be able to have a tidy and clean life, home, and body if you don&#39;t first cultivate a tidy and clean mind - this is the foundation in which to build upon. This requires effort, which is where most people fail, but if you&#39;re set on becoming a high-value man, read on and let&#39;s go together on this journey.</p>

								<h2>Tidiness</h2>
							</header><p>There is no point in talking about hygiene and cleanliness if your spaces are untidy. In principle, it&#39;s possible to clean an untidy room, but not only it&#39;s <em>exponentially</em> harder to clean, it doesn&#39;t <em>feel</em> clean. Think of tidiness as the foundation in which to build cleanliness.</p>
<h2 id="the-konmari-method">The KonMari Method</h2>
<p>By far, the best book on tidiness is <a href="https://amzn.to/2CvMLof">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing by Marie Kondo</a>. While this book teaches you how to declutter your home physically, it focuses on something deeper: the required mindset to <em>become</em> tidy. While <em>doing</em> the things in this book, you will learn how to <em>become</em> tidy in your physical spaces, your virtual spaces, and - most importantly - your mind.</p>
<p>To me, the results of executing this process, and applying these principles and philosophy were impressive. I now own exactly what I need, no more, no less, every single item sparks joy, and I can account for everything I own and know every single place where it should be placed, by heart. I applied these principles to my virtual spaces as well: my laptop&#39;s files and folders and my social networks and I deleted most of them. I also applied these principles to my relationships and decided to stop investing in 38 relationships that did not spark joy. This created the space necessary for me to realize I should invest in some other friendships and that was an incredibly good decision.</p>
<p>By the end of this process I feel I&#39;ve achieved the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A permanent state of tidiness</li>
<li>When it comes to my possessions, I&#39;m no longer attached to the past or fearful about the future, and I therefore no longer keep items because &quot;I don&#39;t want to let go of this photo&quot; or &quot;I may need this item some day&quot;. I realized both these types of items have already fulfilled their purpose and I can now let them go. I learned the importance of discarding and I now discard with a passion, keeping only items that are necessary and/or spark joy. I&#39;ve also learned to make really smart purchases through the same lense: I only buy things that are useful <em>and</em> spark joy.</li>
<li>My physical and virtual spaces have become much better to live in and much easier to clean.</li>
<li>My relationships have greatly improved through this process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mission:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read <a href="https://amzn.to/2CvMLof">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing by Marie Kondo</a></li>
<li>As you read, create a plan of action</li>
<li>Execute on that plan and achieve a permanent state of tidyness</li>

<h2 id="your-space">Your space</h2>
<p>Before you can start working on having a clean body, you need to clean your spaces. There is no point in being clean if you live in a pigsty. If you want to learn how to keep your home clean, you need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Understand the problem</li>
<li>Plan a solution</li>
<li>Execute that solution</li>
</ol>
<p>If this doesn&#39;t work, you didn&#39;t understand the problem, your plan is bad or, obviously, you didn&#39;t execute correctly. Go back, find what failed and fix it.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-problem-why-do-spaces-get-dirty-">Understanding the problem: why do spaces get dirty?</h3>
<p>Assuming you live in a developed country (if you don&#39;t live in a developed country you have bigger problems to solve), your biggest source of dirt is dust in various forms. Let&#39;s understand dust and where dust comes from.</p>
<p>Dust has two sources: 60% of dust comes from the exterior as airborne particles blown from outdoors and tracked-in soil and 40% of dust comes from dead skin shed by people, fibers from carpets, upholstered furniture, pet dander, dust mites (the more dust you have, the more dust mites and vice-versa), food debris and insects and their droppings.</p>
<p>To make this easy to understand, let&#39;s look at the following table:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Source</th>
<th>Breakdown</th>
<th>Absolute Weight</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Exterior</td>
<td></td>
<td>60%</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Obviously, this can only be a rough approximation because every home is different. If you leave your shoes in your entrance hall and you have no carpets, you&#39;ll have no tracked-in soil and no carpet fibers flying around, for example. Nevertheless, having this rough sketch of where dust comes from is an excelent starting point to keep our home clean.</p>
<p>Now that we understand what dust is and where it comes from, let&#39;s attack each source one by one.</p>
<p>Note: I&#39;m a passionate perfectionist, so everything I will say on this and the following topics will be optimized for their most important criteria. In the topic of higiene, the criteria is health and cleanliness. Not style, not decoration. Cleanliness. Health and cleanliness trump style and decoration.</p>
<h3 id="plan-to-solve-the-problem">Plan to solve the problem</h3>
<p>We have several sources of dust. Let&#39;s divide and conquer each.</p>
<h4 id="airborne-particles-blown-from-the-outdoors">Airborne particles blown from the outdoors</h4>
<p>You NEED to air your rooms, ideally every day. Not airing your rooms is not an option because otherwise you will have mold accumulate and rapidly decrease your air quality. Ideally we&#39;d be able to air the rooms in our home while filtering the air coming in from the windows, but since we don&#39;t have that technology yet, with current technology our best option is to let all that fresh air in and purify it post factum.</p>
<p>You have two main ways to keep your air clean and pure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Having a <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/whole-house-air-purifiers/perfect16">whole-house air purifier system with HEPA filters</a> that pulls air from the outside, filters it and delivers clean, pure air to all rooms in your home. Also using <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/putting-tesla-hepa-filter-and-bioweapon-defense-mode-to-the-test">Tesla&#39;s model S and model X bioweapon defence mode</a> keeps you breathing pure air while in your car. Both keep dust, pollen, mold spores, bacteria, viruses and pollution particles outside your spaces.</li>
<li>Having a</li>

<p>What is the best Air purifier in the world?
Portable air purifier vs whole-house air purifier - which is better?
By the way, you should keep your air purifier turned on 24/7?
Zero light for 100% blackout bedroom</p>
<p>The problem with airborne particles blown from the outdoors is that you NEED your home to be aired very often. Idealy, every single day. Otherwise mold will start to rapidly accumulate and the air quality in your rooms will deteriorate very fast leading to breathing disorders and deseases. So NOT airing your rooms is not an option. Unless, you&#39;re building a home from the ground up and want to specifically address this issue by installing a whole-house air purifier system that uses HEPA filters, this means that you WILL have to deal with airborne particles blown from the outdoors.</p>
