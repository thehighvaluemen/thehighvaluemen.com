								<h2>Introduction</h2>
							</header><p>This is a blog for men who want to become high value in the social and dating sense of the word.</p>
<p>I see life in three pillars: health, work and relationships. Health includes things like diet, sleep, exercise and meditation. Work includes things like product building, marketing, productivity, tools and financial management. Relationships include things like grooming, style, social life and dating life.</p>
<p>Admitedly this mental organization of life into these three pillars isn&#39;t perfect because there is some overlap between areas (but me being a perfectionist, I will eventually improve on it), but it works for now.</p>
<p>I used to have a big gaping hole in my social life and my dating life. People didn&#39;t really enjoy being around me very much and that, obviously, made me feel bad. As I decided to face this issue head on and get direct and honest feedback on why this was the case, I realized a very simple but deep truth:</p>
<p>Not taking care of myself sends a very honest and clear signal to everyone around me that I won&#39;t take care of them either.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t save someone from drowning if you, yourself, are drowning. That is why, on airplanes, you put the oxigen on yourself first and your kids later. If you&#39;d like to understand this concept at a deeper, first principles, philosophical level I recommend you read the masterpiece <a href="https://amzn.to/3fFhSM4">Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand</a>. It&#39;s a book that will change the way you see yourself and important concepts like altruism and selfishness in a new, better and more practical light.</p>
<p>In this single page blog, I will take you through a journey of self improvement in the relationship area of life: higiene, grooming, style, social life, dating life and special skills. Beware, I deeply enjoy being thorough, so this journey will take you a while. On the other hand, if you act on everything I teach you, you will come out a much better man.</p>
<p>One last word before we start. The biggest bottleneck to my improvement was, by far, money. Becoming a high value man requires a certain amount of money to buy the equipment and the tools that will help you along the path. There simply is no way around that. Ideally you&#39;d have around 5.000â‚¬ to spend on yourself. If you don&#39;t have that kind of money yet, feel free to read on with the awareness that you&#39;ll come up short. Alternatively focus on getting a lot of money first.</p>
<p>Lastly, I only buy the best possible products for myself. Doing this has served me extremely well in the past and is a principle I wholeheartedly recommend. Spending money on the best is a very smart way to spend your money because these products will last longer, give you better results and a lot less headache. The products I&#39;ve bought for myself are the products I&#39;ll recommend throughout this blog and will also be the way I&#39;m monetizing this piece of my work. If you have any objections to that, please feel free to copy+paste the names of the products I recommend and independently search for them on your own.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let&#39;s get started on our journey.</p>
